concept:(value) [houston boston easy difficult hard great fun boring solved]

# add an event to the Autobiographical memory (ABM)    
    u:(_~subject {sent} _~predicate about the _~object)
        ^addKnowledge($1, $2, $3)  
    $context = $3
    So $1 told you about the $3 via $2


# add feature-value pairs to the SM context
u:(_~feature {it} was _~value)
    ^addKnowledge($context, $1, $2)
    the $context $1 was $2

# recall the context: after this query the context is set
u:(did I get _~predicate from _~subject ) 
    $context = ^queryKnowledge($2, $1, ?)
    Sure I remember, $2 told you about the $context
u:(what was {the}_~feature)
    the $context $1 was ^queryKnowledge($context, $1, ?)
